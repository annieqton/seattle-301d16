# Class 12 - RESTful endpoints and External APIs


*The focus of this day is on presenting the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and  how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs.  Students will need to know how to use jQuery AJAX methods to make GET requests to external public APIs.  Be sure to discuss common issues, such as CORS related errors, to give students a clear expectation of how to work with external APIs.*

- Announcements
	- Project Week is coming! We'll start discussing project ideas TODAY *(like, right meow, 15 minutes tops)* so that we can get a sense of how to scope them.
		- Thursday we'll continue discussing project ideas and start generating a list of possible projects.
		- Friday we'll finalize project teams and get Project Week underway! Teams will be able to pick whatever project they want from the list, or propose a new one, as most of you experienced in 201 last month.
	- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published on Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday.
