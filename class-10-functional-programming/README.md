# Code 301, Class 10: ***Functional Programming***

## Today's Plan

- Announcements
	- Scott has requested feedback...
	- [Lunch & Learn](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lunch-learn-with-iris-carrera-discovering-devops-tickets-30357437914) on DevOps with alum Iris Carrera on Friday! She's awesome! We'll make sure to finish class on time so that you can attend.
	- So that we can make it to the lunch-n-learn on time, we'll need to end class by about 11:50 or so (to allow time to grab your lunch, etc.) We'll still do class today in 3 segments, but will cut breaks to 10 minutes.
	- The current Python 401 will be presenting their midpoint (5-week) projects at 1:00 today in the event space. You are welcome to attend, certainly if you'd like to learn more about Python.
- Standups!
- Week Review
- Code Review

*"Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function.  Not a method.  Not a class.  Not a framework.  Just a function."* - [John Carmack](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/53512300451201024)
